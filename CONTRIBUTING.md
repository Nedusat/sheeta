# Reporting Issue

Have you found an issue in Sheeta? Have a feature request? Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

## Look For an Existing Issue

Before you can create a new issue, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
Be sure to scan through the most popular feature requests.

If you find you issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction

* [Thumbs Up] - upvote
* [Thumbs Down] - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your buf or feature, create a new issue following the guidelines below.

## Writing good bug reports and feature requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of Sheeta
* Reproducible steps that cause the issue

## Final Checkist

Please remember to do the following:
 * [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is an new issue

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
